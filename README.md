This is the official implementation of our paper [Black-box Dataset Ownership Verification via Backdoor Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06015.pdf), accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (2023). This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch, created by [Yiming Li](http://liyiming.tech/) and [Mingyan Zhu]().

The codes will be released upon the acceptance of this paper. Please refer to the [codes](https://github.com/THUYimingLi/Open-sourced_Dataset_Protection) contained in our preliminary [workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05821.pdf) for some insights.
