This is the official implementation of our paper 'Black-box Ownership Verification for Dataset Protection via Backdoor Watermarking'. This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch.

The codes will be released upon the acceptance of this paper. Please refer to the [codes](https://github.com/THUYimingLi/Open-sourced_Dataset_Protection) contained in our preliminary [workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05821.pdf) for some insights.
